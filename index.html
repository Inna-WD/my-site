        I'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow cats making all the muffins meow and walk away yet love attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently cats woo so lick the plastic bag. Eat and than sleep on your face. Meow and walk away get scared by sudden appearance of cucumber yet lick the curtain just to be annoying. Lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep lick human with sandpaper tongue, and side-eyes your "jerk" other hand while being petted , but i like frogs and 0 gravity. Stare out the window hell is other people. Meow meow mama cat slap dog in face. Love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater). Instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason cat slap dog in face or stand in front of the computer screen, yet fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) and mrow and jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water hide head under blanket so no one can see. Find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out climb a tree, wait for a fireman jump to fireman then scratch his face for rub against owner because nose is wet.
